# RESTful_API_Cat_App
I love cats so I made an Android App that takes in the XML of an API that offers cat pictures. The first two pictures are always there and they are my cats. The rest 6 pictures are randomly generated from the API by clicking the button. Each time the button is clicked, new cat pictures are displayed. This app integrated JSON Objects, Picasso Library, and conversion from XML to JSON in order to call these pictures from the website and display them.
