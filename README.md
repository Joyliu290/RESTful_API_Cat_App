# RESTful_API_Cat_App
I love cats so I made an Android App that takes in the XML of an website (API) that offers cat pictures and randomly generates 6 cat pictures by clicking a button. This app integrated JSON Objects, Picasso Library, and conversion from XML to JSON in order to call these pictures from the website and display them.
